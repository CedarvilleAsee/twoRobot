Lots of works needs to be done.


The main focus at this point is to get both robots working very reliably. 

The right robot is quite functional; it is getting in into trouble at the corner with spin turn. Because of that issue the right robot has not completed a full run.


Be sure you understand what you are doing when you change things. If you want to start the robot at somewhere other than the start change line 160 of statemachine.cpp.
